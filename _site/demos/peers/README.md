Peers find and link to each other based on proximity. Each link has a top and a bottom.
When two establish a link, the one with more links is top. A node can't have more than one top.

If a node gains enough subs, it turns into a peer, which has a 5x range and has peer links, with no top/bottom.

### Viruses
Viruses can spawn, and move between nodes.
