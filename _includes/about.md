Hi! My name is Daniel Winkler.

I'm a software developer interested in art and science.

I discovered programming in elementary school with a [TRS-80 BASIC Emulator](http://www.vavasour.ca/jeff/level1/simulator.html){:title="The website is still up 15+ years later!"} and Lego Mindstorms. Beginning in middle school, I spent my summers working in a molecular biology lab. In another life I may have been an electrical engineer, but after frying too many microcontrollers in high school, I moved toward software, which I found more forgiving. Nevertheless, I still find myself somewhere in between software and hardware, tinkering with CNC mills, 3D printers, and robots in general.

<!---

building things, solving problems, I like the intersection between business, software, startups, and all that junk.

I like using software as a tool to explore the world (give examples).
I love finding the beauty in the patterns in nature and in mathematics.
