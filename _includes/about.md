My name is Daniel Winkler.

I am interested in science, programming, and art.

In 2008 I graduated from the Austin Waldorf High School.
I deferred enrollment at the University of Texas at Austin for a year, and worked as a programmer at
Genetic Art Design, working with a 3D CNC Mill. During this time I saved up enough money to travel across
Europe for a month.

In the fall of 2009 I began college as a freshmen at UT majoring in Computer Science.
In fall of 2010 I worked for Mine-Control creating interactive art for museums. In the spring of 2011 I returned to
UT, where I am currently enrolled.

I currently do freelance web development.
