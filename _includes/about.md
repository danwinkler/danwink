My name is Daniel Winkler.

I am interested in science, programming, and art.

I discovered programming in elementary school with a TRS-80 Basic Emulator and Lego Mindstorms. Beginning in middle school, I spent my summers working in a molecular biology lab at the University of Texas at Austin. In another life I may have been an electrical engineer, but after frying too many microcontrollers in high school, I moved toward software, which I found more forgiving. Nevertheless, I still find myself somewhere in between software and hardware, tinkering with CNC mills, 3D printers, and robots in general.

<!---

building things, solving problems, I like the intersection between business, software, startups, and all that junk.

I like using software as a tool to explore the world (give examples).
I love finding the beauty in the patterns in nature and in mathematics.
